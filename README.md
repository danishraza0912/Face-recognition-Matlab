# Face-recognition-Matlab
The project helps to recognise face using machine learning model built in MATLAB. The user needs to train the model by giving atleast 150 images and classify the image name. The program will take the snapshot of the image placed before the webcam. After training the model with various images, the user can test the model by projecting various images and the model will classify the image name accordingly. The model is trained with 99% accuracy.
